It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


### Trigger on GitHub Push

In this example, we'll trigger the pipeline anytime the `master` branch is updated.
```hcl
module "ecs_push_pipeline" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-codepipeline.git?ref=tags/0.1.2"
  name               = "app"
  namespace          = "eg"
  stage              = "staging"
  github_oauth_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  repo_owner         = "cloudposse"
  repo_name          = "example"
  branch             = "master"
  service_name       = "example"
  ecs_cluster_name   = "example-ecs-cluster"
  privileged_mode    = "true"
}
```

### Trigger on GitHub Releases

In this example, we'll trigger anytime a new GitHub release is cut by setting the even type to `release` and using the `json_path` to *exactly* match an `action` of `published`.

```hcl
module "ecs_release_pipeline" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-codepipeline.git?ref=tags/0.1.2"
  name               = "app"
  namespace          = "eg"
  stage              = "staging"
  github_oauth_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  repo_owner         = "cloudposse"
  repo_name          = "example"
  branch             = "master"
  service_name       = "example"
  ecs_cluster_name   = "example-ecs-cluster"
  privileged_mode    = "true"
  github_webhook_events = ["release"]
  webhook_filter_json_path = "$.action"
  webhook_filter_match_equals = "published"
}
```
