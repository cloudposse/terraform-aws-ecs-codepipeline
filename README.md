[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-codepipeline/releases).



For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated test of the complete example using `bats` and `Terratest`, see [test](test).

### Trigger on GitHub Push

In this example, we'll trigger the pipeline anytime the `master` branch is updated.
```hcl
module "ecs_push_pipeline" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-codepipeline.git?ref=master"
  name               = "app"
  namespace          = "eg"
  stage              = "staging"
  github_oauth_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  repo_owner         = "cloudposse"
  repo_name          = "example"
  branch             = "master"
  service_name       = "example"
  ecs_cluster_name   = "example-ecs-cluster"
  privileged_mode    = "true"
}
```

### Trigger on GitHub Releases

In this example, we'll trigger anytime a new GitHub release is cut by setting the even type to `release` and using the `json_path` to *exactly* match an `action` of `published`.

```hcl
module "ecs_release_pipeline" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-codepipeline.git?ref=master"
  name                        = "app"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "staging"
  github_oauth_token          = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  repo_owner                  = "cloudposse"
  repo_name                   = "example"
  branch                      = "master"
  service_name                = "example"
  ecs_cluster_name            = "example-ecs-cluster"
  privileged_mode             = "true"
  github_webhook_events       = ["release"]
  webhook_filter_json_path    = "$.action"
  webhook_filter_match_equals = "published"
}
```

## Examples

Complete usage can be seen in the [terraform-aws-ecs-web-app](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app/blob/master/main.tf) module.

## Example Buildspec

Here's an example `buildspec.yaml`. Stick this in the root of your project repository.

```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
      - aws --version
      - eval $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION --no-include-email)
      - REPOSITORY_URI=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME
      - IMAGE_TAG=$(echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | cut -c 1-7)
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - echo Building the Docker image...
      - REPO_URI=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME
      - docker pull $REPO_URI:latest || true
      - docker build --cache-from $REPO_URI:latest --tag $REPO_URI:latest --tag $REPO_URI:$IMAGE_TAG .
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
      - echo Pushing the Docker images...
      - REPO_URI=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME
      - docker push $REPO_URI:latest
      - docker push $REPO_URI:$IMAGE_TAG
      - echo Writing image definitions file...
      - printf '[{"name":"%s","imageUri":"%s"}]' "$CONTAINER_NAME" "$REPO_URI:$IMAGE_TAG" | tee imagedefinitions.json
artifacts:
  files: imagedefinitions.json
```
